### Description
- After startup,usually after an interrupted reboot (example: while installing updates rebooting in the middle), after the message: 
```
 [ OK ] Started GNOME Display Manager
```
- Then Terminal gets stucked on displaying the underscore dash character : ```_```

1. First Priority Solution (Safest):
--------------------------------
a- Press Ctrl+Alt+F3 (or F2, F4-F6) to switch to a full-screen text console (TTY)
b- Enter your username and password to log in. 
c- Finish and or clean updates, or upgrades: ```sudo apt-get upgrade```
  * Most probably it will ask you to clean or purge the udpates firts, offering a command. Copy, Paste it, execute, (```[Y]``` option)
d- clean reboot: ```reboot```
Mostly this solution should work, even with the GPU drivers (specially form NVIDIA), which are the most probable cause.
